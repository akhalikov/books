 * Given two sorted linked lists, construct a linked list that contains

 *
 * The result list may contain nodes from both input lists.
 * When constructing the result list, we may switch to the other input list
 * only at the point of intersection (which mean the two node with the same value in the lists).
 * You are allowed to use O(1) extra space.
